title Sequential vs Parallel Execution

participant Main
participant "fetchUserData(1)" as U1
participant "fetchUserData(2)" as U2
participant "fetchUserData(3)" as U3
participant "fetchUserData(4)" as U4

== Sequential Execution (Slower) ==
Main -> U1: Call
activate U1
U1 -> U1: Wait 1s
U1 --> Main: Return User 1
deactivate U1

Main -> U2: Call
activate U2
U2 -> U2: Wait 1s
U2 --> Main: Return User 2
deactivate U2

note right of Main
  Total Time: ~2 Seconds
  (1s + 1s)
end note

== Parallel Execution (Faster) ==
Main -> U3: Call
activate U3
Main -> U4: Call
activate U4

U3 -> U3: Wait 1s
U4 -> U4: Wait 1s

U3 --> Main: Return User 3
deactivate U3
U4 --> Main: Return User 4
deactivate U4

note right of Main
  Total Time: ~1 Second
  (Both run at the same time)
end note
