# Promise Demo

This tutorial demonstrates the fundamental concepts of asynchronous programming in Node.js using Promises.

## What is Covered?

1.  **Creating a Promise**: How to wrap an asynchronous operation (like a timer) in a Promise.
2.  **Consuming Promises (The Old Way)**: Using `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` to handle results.
3.  **Consuming Promises (The Modern Way)**: Using `async` and `await` for cleaner, more readable code.
4.  **Sequential Execution**: Ensuring one async operation finishes before the next starts.

## Key Files

*   `index.ts`: The main entry point containing the `orderPizza` simulation and the execution logic.

## How to Run

```bash
npm run start:promise
```
